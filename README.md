## The Frontier Model Intelligence Gap

**We face an intelligence security crisis in AI security.**

As frontier models advance with unprecedented speed, our security evaluation methodologies remain mired in static, outdated approaches that fundamentally underestimate emerging capabilities and vulnerabilities. While current security frameworks focus on isolated benchmarks and discrete testing scenarios, they fail to capture the sophisticated interaction patterns that characterize real-world exploitation attempts against increasingly capable systems.

**AEON represents a paradigm shift in AI security intelligence.**

This repository contains the world's first comprehensive database of structured intelligence on frontier model security behavior, derived from over 10,000 hours of systematic interaction with leading model architectures. Unlike conventional security datasets, AEON implements a sophisticated ontological framework that captures complex interaction patterns, response variations, and vulnerability surfaces across diverse testing scenarios.

## Repository Contents

AEON provides hierarchically structured JSON data from systematic interactions with frontier AI systems, including:

- Structured conversations data with DeepSeekR1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT 4o, Grok 3 and derivative models
- Multi-step adversarial testing sequences with complete context preservation
- Comprehensive model response patterns across security-critical domains
- Temporal evolution data showing capability development over model iterations
- Cross-model comparison data for security pattern analysis

```

## Why Traditional Security Datasets Fall Short

Current AI security approaches suffer from five critical limitations:

1. **Static Representation**: Conventional datasets capture individual prompts and responses without preserving complex interaction dynamics.

2. **Limited Context Depth**: Most security evaluations lack sufficient context preservation to identify vulnerabilities that emerge over extended interactions.

3. **Temporal Blindness**: Traditional datasets provide snapshots without tracking how model behaviors evolve over time and across versions.

4. **Taxonomic Oversimplification**: Existing classification systems use overly simplistic categories that fail to capture nuanced security behaviors.

5. **Insufficient Metadata**: Security datasets typically lack the rich structural metadata needed for sophisticated pattern analysis.

## The AEON Advantage

AEON overcomes these limitations through five key innovations:

### 1. Hierarchical JSON Structure

AEON implements a sophisticated nested JSON structure that preserves complete interaction contexts and relational dependencies:
